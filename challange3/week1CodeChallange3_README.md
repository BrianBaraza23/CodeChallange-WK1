# Net Salary Calculator

This is a small program that calculates the net salary of an employee based on their basic salary and benefits.

## Instructions

The program prompts the user to input their gross salary and total benefits. It then deducts the employee's monthly deductions and outputs the net salary.

#parameters

The user needs to input their gross salary and total benefits. The program deducts NHIF contribution, NSSF contribution, and Payee tax, and then returns the total net salary.

#Language used

The program is built using JavaScript and HTML.

#How it works

The program utilizes several functions to calculate different parameters and ultimately returns the total net salary of the employee.

1. The calculateGrossPay() computes the total gross salary.
2. The function calculateNSSF() calculates NSSF contribution.
3. The function calculatePayee() uses an if-statement to calculate the Payee tax.
4.The function calculateNHIF() uses a switch-case statement to compute the appropriate NHIF deduction.

After all the computations are completed, the program returns the total net salary along with the gross salary of the employee.
