# STUDENT GRADE GENERATOR

This program is a small application that determines a student's grade based on their marks.

## Instructions

The program utilizes a web page pop-up to prompt the user to input their marks. The user should provide their marks within the range of 1-100. Subsequently, the program generates the corresponding grade from A to E based on the inputted mark.

#Grading Scale

The grades are allocated based on the following scale:

A: Greater than 79
B: 60 to 79
C: 59 to 49
D: 40 to 49
E: Less than 40

#Language used

The program is developed using JavaScript and HTML.

#How it works

The program employs a Switch Case statement to handle the logic. It retrieves the user-inputted marks, iterates through the various grade options, and matches the mark to the appropriate grade. The program then returns the corresponding grade via the HTML web page.


#Requirements

This program should run on any modern web browser without the need for any special installations. It utilizes standard HTML and JavaScript.
